# UAV-Sensor-Package-Delivery-System
UAV sensor package deployment and retrieval system using electropermanent magnets

Hardware include:
1. 3D files of UAV frame along with the sensor package retrieval harness.
2. Wireless electropermanent magnet (EPM) controller PCB design.

Software include:
1. Arduino code for NRF24L01 wireless transmitter
2. Arduino code for NRF24L01 wireless receiver

overview:
The system is designed to take in user input directly from a PWM 2.4 GHz receiver and issue commands to the
two electropermanent magnets securing the package either to the UAV or the structure on demand.
